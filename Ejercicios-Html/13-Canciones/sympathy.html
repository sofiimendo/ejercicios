    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>Please allow me to introduce myself
        I'm a man of wealth and taste
        I've been around for a long, long years
        Stole million man's soul an faith</p>
    <p>And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
        Had his moment of doubt and pain
        Made damn sure that Pilate
        Washed his hands and sealed his fate</p>  
    <p>Pleased to meet you
        Hope you guess my name
        But what's puzzling you
        Is the nature of my game</p> 
    <p>Stuck around St. Petersburg
        When I saw it was a time for a change
        Killed Tsar and his ministers
        Anastasia screamed in vain</p>  
    <p>I rode a tank
        Held a general's rank
        When the blitzkrieg raged
        And the bodies stank</p>     
    <p>Pleased to meet you
        Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
        Ah, what's puzzling you
        Is the nature of my game, oh yeah</p>  
    <p>I watched with glee
        While your kings and queens
        Fought for ten decades
        For the gods they made</p>    
    <p>I shouted out
        Who killed the Kennedys?
        When after all
        It was you and me</p>  
    <p>Let me please introduce myself
        I'm a man of wealth and taste
        And I laid traps for troubadours
        Who get killed before they reached Bombay</p> 
    <p>Pleased to meet you
        Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
        But what's puzzling you
        Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby</p>  
    <p>Pleased to meet you
        Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
        But what's confusing you
        Is just the nature of my game</p>  
    <p>Just as every cop is a criminal
        And all the sinners saints
        As heads is tails
        Just call me Lucifer
        'Cause I'm in need of some restraint</p> 
    <p>So if you meet me
        Have some courtesy
        Have some sympathy, and some taste
        Use all your well-learned politnesse
        Or I'll lay your soul to waste, mm yeah</p>   
    <p>Pleased to meet you
        Hope you guessed my name, mm yeah
        But what's puzzling you
        Is the nature of my game, mm mean it, get down</p> 
    <p>Woo, who
        Oh yeah, get on down
        Oh yeah
        Aah yeah</p>    
    <p>Tell me baby, what's my name?
        Tell me honey, can ya guess my name?
        Tell me baby, what's my name?
        I tell you one time, you're to blame</p>   
    <p>What's my name
        Tell me, baby, what's my name?
        Tell me, sweetie, what's my name?</p>
