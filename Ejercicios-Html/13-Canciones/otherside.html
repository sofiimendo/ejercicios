    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>How long, how long will I slide?
        Separate my side, I don't
        I don't believe it's bad
        Slit my throat it's all I ever</p>   
        <br>
    <p>I heard your voice through a photograph
        I thought it up and brought up the past
        Once you know you can never go back
        I gotta take it on the other side</p>  
        <br>  
    <p>Centuries are what it meant to me
        A cemetery where I marry the sea
        Stranger things could never change my mind
        I gotta take it on the other side
        Take it on the other side
        Take it on, take it on</p>    
        <br>
    <p>How long, how long will I slide?
        Separate my side, I don't
        I don't believe it's bad
        Slit my throat it's all I ever</p>  
        <br>  
    <p>Pour my life into a paper cup
        The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
        She wants to know, am I still a slut?
        I've got to take it on the other side</p> 
        <br>
    <p>A scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
        A candidate for a soul mate bled
        Push the trigger and pull the thread
        I gotta take it on the other side
        Take it on the other side
        Take it on
        Take it on</p>      
        <br>  
    <p>How long, how long will I slide?
        Separate my side, I don't
        I don't believe it's bad
        Slit my throat it's all I ever</p>  
        <br>  
    <p>Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
        Burn me out, leave me on the other side
        I yell and tell it that it's not my friend
        I tear it down, I tear it down
        And then it's born again</p>  
        <br>
    <p>How long, how long will I slide?
        Separate my side, I don't
        I don't believe it's bad
        Slit my throat it's all I ever</p> 
        <br>
    <p>How long, I don't, I don't believe it's bad
        Slit my throat it's all I ever</p>
